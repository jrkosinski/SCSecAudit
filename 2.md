### Types of Audits

### First pass: SCAN
#### Technical Issues
- delegatecall 
The EVM currently offers three opcodes for calling to another contract: CALL, CALLCODE, and [DELEGATECALL](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7). The latter is unique in that, as contract A calls into contract B, the logic of contract B is executed on the _state and memory context of contract A_. When misused it can inadvertently expose sensitive data or logic of contract A, to contract B. While _delegatecall_ in itself is not inherently 'insecure' per se, its context-preserving nature can lead to misunderstandings that can in turn lead to vulnerabilities. It's been the basis of many known major vulnerabilities. Please have a look at []() for a very basic demonstration, and []() for a more complex and realistic demonstration. 
- any call to outside unknown contract 
- fallback methods 
- sketchy randomness
- overflows and underflows
- reentrant methods 
- methods that accept dynamic calls 
- sketchy rounding 
- sensitive data stored in contract 
- unprotected data 
- self-destruct

#### Trust Issues 
- upgradeability
- oracles
- self-destruct
- centralization
### Second pass: EXPLORE 
- write test suite 
- try to actively hack
